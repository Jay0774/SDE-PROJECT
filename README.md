##### 3. After this perform the workload testing.  

#### -> After the worload testing get the response time and other data from Jmeter.

#### -> Finally perform the Kmeans clustering to find the optimal number of clusters required for the Micoservice application and the number of VM's required using data provided after workload testing.
